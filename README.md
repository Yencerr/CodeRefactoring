# CodeRefactoring

In html, condince surtain classes under the same class name to assist with organization.

In CSS, condinced surtain classes together over comands to condince the amount of things having to be read when loading. 

changed colors through the webpage to be more consistant.

The hoped outcome was to possibly increase load speed by making the page have to make less comands when opening. To also make code a little easier to follow and read over the page.
